Contains my dotfiles

Do note that some of the configuration files contain other people's configurations, and thus I cannot take credit for them.

Using lxappearance to set:
  GTK Theme: Arc-Dark-Solid

  sudo pacman -S lxappearance arc-solid-gtk-theme capitaine-cursors
  paru -S arc-gtk-theme-colorpack-git
Using kvantum to set Qt Theme to KvArcDark which comes in-built with kvantum-qt5
